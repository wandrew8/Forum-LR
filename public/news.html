                                    Unique Integration Conference for Asylum Seekers Held in Fuzine, Croatia

                                    On Monday, September 24, 2018 the unique six-day conference was completed in the
                                    picturesque village of Fuzine, Croatia. More than 50 asylum seekers, including
                                    an international team of facilitators, humanitarian and faith-based activists
                                    from twelve countries, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Iran including, came
                                    together to wrestle with a number of burning questions that asylum seekers in
                                    Croatia and Europe are facing daily in their prolonged processes of waiting
                                    between interviews and issuing of the final government decision to their
                                    requests to stay permanently in Croatia.

                                    This dynamic and at times intense conference, with the theme “Moving Forward in
                                    Truth, with Courage and Hope,” represented the extension of the ROM – Renewing
                                    Our Minds international leadership project, and was organized by “Forum for
                                    Leadership and Reconciliation” (US), and “Business as Mission” (Zagreb,
                                    Croatia), in partnership with ECPM – European Christian Political Movement, from
                                    Brussels, Belgium. The conference was conducted in English, with simultaneous
                                    translations provided into Farsi and Arabic.
                                </p>

                                    The conference objectives included helping seekers of the international
                                    protection in Croatia, and those who have had their asylum statuses favorably
                                    resolved recently, gain a balanced understanding of the integration processes
                                    and related challenges in Croatia. Likewise, the conference organizers wanted to
                                    hear from the participating asylum seekers what are their most daring challenges
                                    as they are often waiting for two to three years, driven by uncertainty and
                                    anxiety, to have their requests answered by the Croatian Government? In short,
                                    the objectives of the conference were to help immigrants in Croatia and Europe
                                    to integrate well, and to help them grasp the essentials of European culture and
                                    Christian faith.

                                    The daily afternoon workshops helped the conference participants, most of whom
                                    were family men and women with children, to vocalize their most urging needs and
                                    anxieties. Some of the most frequent questions were: Why is the process of
                                    waiting to receive the final decision taking so long? Why are some asylum
                                    seekers, who have come to Croatia only recently receiving their positive answers
                                    sooner than those who entered Croatia two or three years ago, and are still
                                    waiting to have their cases finalized?
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Other questions included: While only a few asylum seekers have been allowed to
                                    work legally in Croatia, as they are waiting to have their asylum requests
                                    finalized, why are many more denied the privilege to work legally? Why is it
                                    that under the law some helpful privileges are promised to the waiting asylums
                                    seekers, such as learning the Croatian language and access to health care, while
                                    in practice those privileges are seldom accessible? Why is the Croatian
                                    government not helping reunite the families separated in different places and
                                    countries along their refugee trail?</p>

                                    Through carefully selected lectures, and much time devoted to questions and
                                    group conversation, the organizers of the conference devoted their attention to
                                    the issues of law, culture and place of religion in the Croatian society; the
                                    three overlapping areas whose understanding is necessary if the Integration into
                                    the Croatian society is to be fully appreciated and implemented. Special
                                    attention was given to building of friendship and trust between Muslim and
                                    Christian asylum-seekers, as well as building friendship and trust between
                                    asylum seekers and the Croatian citizens and institutions.

                                    At the workshop about the role of faith and religious communities in Croatian it
                                    became obvious that the asylum seekers are expecting more empathy and support
                                    from the religious communities of Croatia than from the government. “Since it is
                                    in the nature of religious communities to care about vulnerable groups,” they
                                    reasoned, “religious organizations, churches and faith-based groups should be
                                    able to put in place a synchronized care network” that could efficiently help
                                    asylum seekers in the months and years of uncertainty and prolonged months and
                                    years of anxious waiting; and also help the asylum holders who have recently
                                    been granted the right to remain in Croatia. For example, they could help the
                                    new asylum holders, especially those with children, to find their first home and
                                    first job.

                                    The strength of this conference was that it dealt insightfully and
                                    compassionately with the challenges of integration as observed and handled by
                                    the three sides involved in the lives of asylum seekers: as they are handled by
                                    the Croatian and European laws and legal systems; as they are experienced by the
                                    asylum seekers themselves; and as they are addressed by the church and
                                    faith-based organizations and groups. Since most of the asylum seekers are
                                    spending long periods of time anxiously waiting for the final and affirming
                                    decision from the government, often being previously rejected two or three
                                    times, it became clear in the initial days of the conference that most of asylum
                                    seekers-in-waiting have suffered from the loss of trust in the Croatian
                                    government, its institutions and supporting agencies. The conference leadership
                                    team, which included also a group of asylum seekers and asylum holders, worked
                                    diligently to see the damaged trust and relationships healed and restored, and
                                    promised to contribute to the conversation by making the findings of the
                                    conference available to the public and relevant institutions.

                                    The quality of the conference was enhanced by the choice of speakers and
                                    facilitators, and experienced ROM (Renewing Our Minds) team members. Among them
                                    were Heather Staff, an emerging UK politician and Policy Adviser to Kate Green
                                    MP; Leo van Doesburg, Director for European Affairs for the European Christian
                                    Political Movement (ECPM); Amir Hekmatpour, spiritual advisor and faith mentor
                                    from the US; Donya and Shayan Spanta, asylum holders and humanitarian activists
                                    from Iran, now Croatian residents; Mihal Kreko, Christian pastor and
                                    humanitarian activist from Zagreb, Croatia; Tihomir Kukolja, Renewing Our Minds
                                    (ROM) Director; and Ana Šutalo, a representative of the Croatian Ministry of the
                                    Interior, and Asylum Support Expert. Ana Šutalo’s contribution to the conference
                                    was especially significant as she explained in detail what needed to happen once
                                    an asylum seeker has received a residential status in Croatia.

                                    Although the conference dealt with very serious themes and issues, often
                                    accompanied by heated but honest discussion, this event also became a festival
                                    of friendship through the relaxing, and spirit-lifting hours of sharing in the
                                    energetic feasts of music, dances, customs, culture of the countries represented
                                    at the conference, and moments of thanksgiving. However, the special feature of
                                    the conference were the moments that addressed the spiritual hunger manifest by
                                    all participants at the conference, Christians and Muslims alike. No hours were
                                    too long, and no optional workshops too many for the groups of participants who
                                    never ceased to ask new questions as they listened to Amir Hekmatpour, even in
                                    the hours outside his official speaking sessions. Amir Hekmatpour, from the US
                                    and with the origins from Iran, served as a spiritual adviser, mentor and
                                    speaker at the conference.

                                    “The results of this integration conference surpassed all our expectations” –
                                    stated Mihal Kreko, one of the organizers of the 2018 ROM Integration
                                    Conference, and the director of a unique integration project currently under
                                    construction in Zagreb, Croatia, known as “The House of Hope.” Heather Staff, a
                                    speaker at the conference and a UK politician commented: “I’ve never before
                                    experienced the level of honesty in our conversations as at this conference, and
                                    even when we disagreed we did it agreeably.” “The Thanksgiving Eveningon the
                                    closing Sunday demonstrated that we all became one forgiving, forgiven and
                                    reconciled family of friends who loved each other. By the end of the conference
                                    one could see that the faces of asylum seekers radiated with new hope and new
                                    joy,” said Liviu Bocaniala, the conference music director. And Tihomir Kukolja,
                                    the ROM – Renewing Our Minds Director stated: “This conference opened my eyes. I
                                    learned more about the hardships of being an asylum seeker in six days of this
                                    conference than in previous three years”.

                                    what she had gained at the 2018 ROM Regional Follow-up Trip, June 2018, as the

                                    A celebration of friendship that engaged people where they were at, listened,
                                    reflected and learned. The trip not only engaged on a personal level with people
                                    but also physically was a chance to see where people lived, worked and went to
                                    school. We saw the highs and the challenges of everyday life and the community
                                    that was sustained through the common denominator which was ROM/EDI.

                                    For some our visit brought renewed hope and encouraged a sense of right time and
                                    right place, for others it was a chance to remember why they were part of ROM.
                                    Yet this was not just about engaging with old friends it was also a chance to
                                    meet people who had questions about Jesus, about politics, integrity and where
                                    the world is headed. These people I hope will come to be part of ROM/EDI next

                                    It was clear from conversations that ROM has impacted people, often career
                                    choices were changed or studies undertaken because of what was heard at ROM, it
                                    brought home the responsibility leaders and speakers have at ROM. What we say is
                                    not forgotten and can have life changing impact. ROM made people think, issues
                                    came up of grace and forgiveness, people did not have an issue with ‘too much
                                    Jesus’ and for the most part they wanted to be challenged.

                                    There were feelings from some people that we need to talk through issues of
                                    nationalism and engage with past conflicts in case we forget them. People also
                                    seemed happy that we had addressed the refugee crisis and invited refugees to be
                                    among us. In Romania and Albania there was a desperate thirst for examples of
                                    good political leadership and ways to combat isolation, corruption and how to
                                    argue/disagree well. How do you give dignity and respect while maintaining
                                    principles, how do you work through issues that are not black and white but
                                    complex?

                                    It was in Albania and Romania especially that perhaps a new format for ROM could
                                    be looked at, more intimate gatherings or living room talks and panel
                                    interviews/debates that can go along with talks. These panel events were
                                    effective and engaging as they allowed greater questions from people. The living
                                    room dialogue session in Cluj was a great example of an informal way to talk
                                    about politics, yet open it up to a wider framework where friendly dialogue
                                    without judgement could be had.

                                    The biggest take away for myself however came in the sense of community that
                                    followed us wherever we went, quality conversation time amongst those that came
                                    and the people we came to serve.

                                    I was amazed by a conversation in Novi Sad, Serbia with a lady I had not met
                                    before, it highlighted how ROM gave her community and how she felt loved and
                                    never judged. How much she missed the sense of being in community and how life
                                    at the moment is difficult for her. She was able to connect with a lady in a
                                    similar situation and they are now able to talk regularly, she really needed our
                                    visit. Another young man shared how he changed his studies and as a result now
                                    works for Samaritans purse and is looking for other jobs in humanitarian aid.

                                    In Belgrade, Serbia I was amazed by the hospitality we were shown and the growth
                                    in some people, likewise seeing people from my small group who are on a journey
                                    not just with Jesus but in making change in the lives around them. I feel we
                                    were able to bless many people who had little and I hope we also helped people
                                    to engage with what is going on around them and examine what it is they really
                                    think and feel.

                                    In Macedonia there was a small group of people but we had quality conversations
                                    including the excellent bookshop/culture centre that is one of those ideas you
                                    think wow this needs to happen in other areas. I was so encouraged to see 3
                                    ladies who had been friends since 2002 and met because of ROM. Perhaps a ROM
                                    coffee shop/resource centre could be started in different places? Dream big as
                                    they say

                                    In Albania I was amazed by the amount of people who came to the dinners, and the
                                    quality of conversations, looking back Albania really needed our attention for
                                    much longer. The church service in Berat was excellent and spiritual refreshment
                                    for me. The panel interviews and talks engaged people and showed a desperate
                                    need for leadership in politics. Those that had been on ROM were hungry for
                                    more, but also showed incredible kindness and hospitality. ROM and EDI have
                                    clearly impacted people here and I could see how hard it is to not slip into the
                                    trends of nationalism but they are fighting it and trying to promote quality
                                    thinking and good disagreement.

                                    Cluj, Romania was my stop, and I was blessed in every way by the sculptor Liviu
                                    Mocan and what his art is bringing to Cluj and Romania. Even though the weather
                                    was against us, again we had quality conversations in the evening at a group set
                                    up by Debora Salgau, a young lady who had been on ROM last year. Even though I
                                    spoke at this event I came away incredibly blessed that there are people willing
                                    and wanting to fight corruption, the informal setting was perfect for
                                    discussion. I was also blessed by the hospitality shown to me by the people I
                                    stayed with, incredible Christ like love,

                                    If I have to summarise my time on this celebration of friendship it would be to
                                    say community is vital, people need community and miss it. ROM has helped to
                                    build it and it must be sustained which includes follow up, communication, a
                                    text now and then, especially from leaders and speakers. ROM can change people’s
                                    thinking and this can make life harder when people leave, and may require some
                                    after care.

                                    For ROM to stay relevant it needs to keep Jesus at the centre, His life, love,
                                    grace and forgiveness are what makes ROM so distinct from other gatherings and
                                    talks. It is because of Jesus that we do what we do and seek to help people
                                    become better leaders who act justly, love mercy and walk humbly. Jesus inspires
                                    how we should talk and care for each other even when we have differences of
                                    theology or political opinion but it also makes us brave. ROMs relevance is
                                    needed more than ever, its vital we do not shy away from tackling the
                                    ideological positions that the world seems to be taking around – fascism and
                                    communism or simply nationalism.

                                    It is vital we keep helping people to see the perspective of each other ‘to walk
                                    in their shoes’ and learn how to forgive and show grace. It is vital we show how
                                    to speak truth while doing so in love and it is vital we help people to build
                                    community and show love to not just the neighbour but the enemy. ROM is
                                    relevant, it allows for complexity of thought, dialogue and the ability to
                                    connect Jesus teachings to everyday leadership. It should not be afraid to
                                    welcome those of other faiths and help them journey and see why Jesus teaching
                                    is different and why it stands the test of time and it should always do so from
                                    a place of love.

                    Minds ministry
                    has always remained faithful to its message of friendship, reconciliation and sacrificial
                    leadership. But what made its ministry unique and effective was its focus on Jesus. For all those
                    years it has been on my heart, as its director for the past eighteen years, and on the hearts of the
                    core team to make sure Jesus remains the center of the ROM ministry, and keeps informing everything
                    we are, do and teach at ROM. This video features several short Jesus centered highlights I shared at
                    various ROM gatherings in the past years. I’ve enjoyed leading ROM very much but of all aspects of
                    ROM leaderships I loved teaching about Jesus the most. I’m confident that under the leadership of
                    Bojan Ruvarac, ROM’s new director, this precious ministry will continue to be firmly rooted in
                    Jesus. This video is enhanced with a random selection of photos depicting many moments in the 20
                    years long ROM history.</p>

                    Reconciliation. Our African friends shared their experiences with AYLF and Cornerstone Development.
                    We were impressed, humbled and inspired at the same time as we watched how young people of Uganda
                    and East Africa are becoming transformed into the future leaders of this region thanks to the
                    dedicated work of the African youth Leadership Forum and Cornerstone Development, and their vision
                    of “nurturing a new breed of African leaders”. Out of our visit and time spent with our friends from
                    AYLF a new vision has emerged: AYLF is seriously planning to move forward with an African version of

                    more importantly, we want to ask a question: “Where are they now? Are they still wondering from one
                    country to another, unwelcome, shifted and tossed around? Are they alive? Are their families
                    together? Are their children safe?” Listen to the real observations made by some who volunteered
