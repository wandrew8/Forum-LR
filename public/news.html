                                        On Monday, September 24, 2018 the unique six-day conference was completed in the
                                        picturesque village of Fuzine, Croatia. More than 50 asylum seekers, including
                                        an international team of facilitators, humanitarian and faith-based activists
                                        from twelve countries, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Iran including, came
                                        together to wrestle with a number of burning questions that asylum seekers in
                                        Croatia and Europe are facing daily in their prolonged processes of waiting
                                        between interviews and issuing of the final government decision to their
                                        requests to stay permanently in Croatia.

                                        This dynamic and at times intense conference, with the theme “Moving Forward in
                                        Truth, with Courage and Hope,” represented the extension of the ROM – Renewing
                                        Our Minds international leadership project, and was organized by “Forum for
                                        Leadership and Reconciliation” (US), and “Business as Mission” (Zagreb,
                                        Croatia), in partnership with ECPM – European Christian Political Movement, from
                                        Brussels, Belgium. The conference was conducted in English, with simultaneous
                                        translations provided into Farsi and Arabic.
                                    </p>

                                        The conference objectives included helping seekers of the international
                                        protection in Croatia, and those who have had their asylum statuses favorably
                                        resolved recently, gain a balanced understanding of the integration processes
                                        and related challenges in Croatia. Likewise, the conference organizers wanted to
                                        hear from the participating asylum seekers what are their most daring challenges
                                        as they are often waiting for two to three years, driven by uncertainty and
                                        anxiety, to have their requests answered by the Croatian Government? In short,
                                        the objectives of the conference were to help immigrants in Croatia and Europe
                                        to integrate well, and to help them grasp the essentials of European culture and
                                        Christian faith.
                                    </p>

                                        The daily afternoon workshops helped the conference participants, most of whom
                                        were family men and women with children, to vocalize their most urging needs and
                                        anxieties. Some of the most frequent questions were: Why is the process of
                                        waiting to receive the final decision taking so long? Why are some asylum
                                        seekers, who have come to Croatia only recently receiving their positive answers
                                        sooner than those who entered Croatia two or three years ago, and are still
                                        waiting to have their cases finalized?
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        Other questions included: While only a few asylum seekers have been allowed to
                                        work legally in Croatia, as they are waiting to have their asylum requests
                                        finalized, why are many more denied the privilege to work legally? Why is it
                                        that under the law some helpful privileges are promised to the waiting asylums
                                        seekers, such as learning the Croatian language and access to health care, while
                                        in practice those privileges are seldom accessible? Why is the Croatian
                                        government not helping reunite the families separated in different places and
                                        countries along their refugee trail?</p>

                                        Through carefully selected lectures, and much time devoted to questions and
                                        group conversation, the organizers of the conference devoted their attention to
                                        the issues of law, culture and place of religion in the Croatian society; the
                                        three overlapping areas whose understanding is necessary if the Integration into

                                        attention was given to building of friendship and trust between Muslim and

                                        became obvious that the asylum seekers are expecting more empathy and support
                                        from the religious communities of Croatia than from the government. “Since it is
                                        in the nature of religious communities to care about vulnerable groups,” they
                                        reasoned, “religious organizations, churches and faith-based groups should be
                                        able to put in place a synchronized care network” that could efficiently help
                                        asylum seekers in the months and years of uncertainty and prolonged months and
                                        years of anxious waiting; and also help the asylum holders who have recently
                                        been granted the right to remain in Croatia. For example, they could help the
                                        new asylum holders, especially those with children, to find their first home and
                                        first job.

                                        The strength of this conference was that it dealt insightfully and
                                        compassionately with the challenges of integration as observed and handled by
                                        the three sides involved in the lives of asylum seekers: as they are handled by
                                        the Croatian and European laws and legal systems; as they are experienced by the
                                        asylum seekers themselves; and as they are addressed by the church and
                                        faith-based organizations and groups. Since most of the asylum seekers are
                                        spending long periods of time anxiously waiting for the final and affirming
                                        decision from the government, often being previously rejected two or three
                                        times, it became clear in the initial days of the conference that most of asylum
                                        seekers-in-waiting have suffered from the loss of trust in the Croatian
                                        government, its institutions and supporting agencies. The conference leadership
                                        team, which included also a group of asylum seekers and asylum holders, worked
                                        diligently to see the damaged trust and relationships healed and restored, and
                                        promised to contribute to the conversation by making the findings of the
                                        conference available to the public and relevant institutions.

                                        The quality of the conference was enhanced by the choice of speakers and
                                        facilitators, and experienced ROM (Renewing Our Minds) team members. Among them
                                        were Heather Staff, an emerging UK politician and Policy Adviser to Kate Green
                                        MP; Leo van Doesburg, Director for European Affairs for the European Christian
                                        Political Movement (ECPM); Amir Hekmatpour, spiritual advisor and faith mentor
                                        from the US; Donya and Shayan Spanta, asylum holders and humanitarian activists
                                        from Iran, now Croatian residents; Mihal Kreko, Christian pastor and
                                        humanitarian activist from Zagreb, Croatia; Tihomir Kukolja, Renewing Our Minds
                                        (ROM) Director; and Ana Šutalo, a representative of the Croatian Ministry of the
                                        Interior, and Asylum Support Expert. Ana Šutalo’s contribution to the conference
                                        was especially significant as she explained in detail what needed to happen once
                                        an asylum seeker has received a residential status in Croatia.

                                        Although the conference dealt with very serious themes and issues, often
                                        accompanied by heated but honest discussion, this event also became a festival
                                        of friendship through the relaxing, and spirit-lifting hours of sharing in the
                                        energetic feasts of music, dances, customs, culture of the countries represented
                                        at the conference, and moments of thanksgiving. However, the special feature of
                                        the conference were the moments that addressed the spiritual hunger manifest by
                                        all participants at the conference, Christians and Muslims alike. No hours were
                                        too long, and no optional workshops too many for the groups of participants who
                                        never ceased to ask new questions as they listened to Amir Hekmatpour, even in
                                        the hours outside his official speaking sessions. Amir Hekmatpour, from the US
                                        and with the origins from Iran, served as a spiritual adviser, mentor and
                                        speaker at the conference.

                                        “The results of this integration conference surpassed all our expectations” –
                                        stated Mihal Kreko, one of the organizers of the 2018 ROM Integration
                                        Conference, and the director of a unique integration project currently under
                                        construction in Zagreb, Croatia, known as “The House of Hope.” Heather Staff, a
                                        speaker at the conference and a UK politician commented: “I’ve never before
                                        experienced the level of honesty in our conversations as at this conference, and
                                        even when we disagreed we did it agreeably.” “The Thanksgiving Eveningon the
                                        closing Sunday demonstrated that we all became one forgiving, forgiven and
                                        reconciled family of friends who loved each other. By the end of the conference
                                        one could see that the faces of asylum seekers radiated with new hope and new
                                        joy,” said Liviu Bocaniala, the conference music director. And Tihomir Kukolja,
                                        the ROM – Renewing Our Minds Director stated: “This conference opened my eyes. I
                                        learned more about the hardships of being an asylum seeker in six days of this
                                        conference than in previous three years”.

                                        team visited the ROM and EDI Alumni in Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Romania.

                                        A celebration of friendship that engaged people where they were at, listened,
                                        reflected and learned. The trip not only engaged on a personal level with people
                                        but also physically was a chance to see where people lived, worked and went to
                                        school. We saw the highs and the challenges of everyday life and the community
                                        that was sustained through the common denominator which was ROM/EDI.

                                        For some our visit brought renewed hope and encouraged a sense of right time and
                                        right place, for others it was a chance to remember why they were part of ROM.
                                        Yet this was not just about engaging with old friends it was also a chance to
                                        meet people who had questions about Jesus, about politics, integrity and where
                                        the world is headed. These people I hope will come to be part of ROM/EDI next
                                        year.


                                    </p>

                                        It was clear from conversations that ROM has impacted people, often career
                                        choices were changed or studies undertaken because of what was heard at ROM, it
                                        brought home the responsibility leaders and speakers have at ROM. What we say is
                                        not forgotten and can have life changing impact. ROM made people think, issues
                                        came up of grace and forgiveness, people did not have an issue with ‘too much
                                        Jesus’ and for the most part they wanted to be challenged.

                                        There were feelings from some people that we need to talk through issues of
                                        nationalism and engage with past conflicts in case we forget them. People also
                                        seemed happy that we had addressed the refugee crisis and invited refugees to be
                                        among us. In Romania and Albania there was a desperate thirst for examples of
                                        good political leadership and ways to combat isolation, corruption and how to
                                        argue/disagree well. How do you give dignity and respect while maintaining
                                        principles, how do you work through issues that are not black and white but
                                        complex?

                                        It was in Albania and Romania especially that perhaps a new format for ROM could
                                        be looked at, more intimate gatherings or living room talks and panel
                                        interviews/debates that can go along with talks. These panel events were
                                        effective and engaging as they allowed greater questions from people. The living
                                        room dialogue session in Cluj was a great example of an informal way to talk
                                        about politics, yet open it up to a wider framework where friendly dialogue
                                        without judgement could be had.

                                        The biggest take away for myself however came in the sense of community that
                                        followed us wherever we went, quality conversation time amongst those that came
                                        and the people we came to serve.

                                        I was amazed by a conversation in Novi Sad, Serbia with a lady I had not met
                                        before, it highlighted how ROM gave her community and how she felt loved and
                                        never judged. How much she missed the sense of being in community and how life
                                        at the moment is difficult for her. She was able to connect with a lady in a
                                        similar situation and they are now able to talk regularly, she really needed our
                                        visit. Another young man shared how he changed his studies and as a result now
                                        works for Samaritans purse and is looking for other jobs in humanitarian aid.

                                        In Belgrade, Serbia I was amazed by the hospitality we were shown and the growth
                                        in some people, likewise seeing people from my small group who are on a journey
                                        not just with Jesus but in making change in the lives around them. I feel we
                                        were able to bless many people who had little and I hope we also helped people
                                        to engage with what is going on around them and examine what it is they really
                                        think and feel.

                                        In Macedonia there was a small group of people but we had quality conversations
                                        including the excellent bookshop/culture centre that is one of those ideas you
                                        think wow this needs to happen in other areas. I was so encouraged to see 3
                                        ladies who had been friends since 2002 and met because of ROM. Perhaps a ROM
                                        coffee shop/resource centre could be started in different places? Dream big as
                                        they say

                                        In Albania I was amazed by the amount of people who came to the dinners, and the
                                        quality of conversations, looking back Albania really needed our attention for
                                        much longer. The church service in Berat was excellent and spiritual refreshment
                                        for me. The panel interviews and talks engaged people and showed a desperate
                                        need for leadership in politics. Those that had been on ROM were hungry for
                                        more, but also showed incredible kindness and hospitality. ROM and EDI have
                                        clearly impacted people here and I could see how hard it is to not slip into the
                                        trends of nationalism but they are fighting it and trying to promote quality
                                        thinking and good disagreement.

                                        Cluj, Romania was my stop, and I was blessed in every way by the sculptor Liviu
                                        Mocan and what his art is bringing to Cluj and Romania. Even though the weather
                                        was against us, again we had quality conversations in the evening at a group set
                                        up by Debora Salgau, a young lady who had been on ROM last year. Even though I
                                        spoke at this event I came away incredibly blessed that there are people willing
                                        and wanting to fight corruption, the informal setting was perfect for
                                        discussion. I was also blessed by the hospitality shown to me by the people I
                                        stayed with, incredible Christ like love,

                                        If I have to summarise my time on this celebration of friendship it would be to
                                        say community is vital, people need community and miss it. ROM has helped to
                                        build it and it must be sustained which includes follow up, communication, a
                                        text now and then, especially from leaders and speakers. ROM can change people’s
                                        thinking and this can make life harder when people leave, and may require some
                                        after care.

                                    </p>

                                        For ROM to stay relevant it needs to keep Jesus at the centre, His life, love,
                                        grace and forgiveness are what makes ROM so distinct from other gatherings and
                                        talks. It is because of Jesus that we do what we do and seek to help people
                                        become better leaders who act justly, love mercy and walk humbly. Jesus inspires
                                        how we should talk and care for each other even when we have differences of
                                        theology or political opinion but it also makes us brave. ROMs relevance is
                                        needed more than ever, its vital we do not shy away from tackling the
                                        ideological positions that the world seems to be taking around – fascism and
                                        communism or simply nationalism.

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        It is vital we keep helping people to see the perspective of each other ‘to walk
                                        in their shoes’ and learn how to forgive and show grace. It is vital we show how
                                        to speak truth while doing so in love and it is vital we help people to build
                                        community and show love to not just the neighbour but the enemy. ROM is
                                        relevant, it allows for complexity of thought, dialogue and the ability to
                                        connect Jesus teachings to everyday leadership. It should not be afraid to
                                        welcome those of other faiths and help them journey and see why Jesus teaching
                                        is different and why it stands the test of time and it should always do so from
                                        a place of love.
