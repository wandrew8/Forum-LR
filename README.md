# Forum for Leadership and Reconciliation

## Overview 
Forum for Leadership and Reconciliation is a company website created for a client to display company news and information. The client's original site was not complete, full of broken links and unadequate for the client's needs. Using much of the same content, I restyled the website from scratch and added a number of new features including:
* Blog posts are scraped from the client's blog and displayed in the news section
* Using the youtube data api, videos from the client's youtube channel are displayed 
* The "contact us" form is functional and properly sending messages to the client's email

You can visit the deployed site [here](https://forumlr.herokuapp.com/).

## Tech Used 
* HTML / CSS / MDBootstrap
* JavaScript
* Node and Express 
* AOS (Animations on Scroll) Library for card animations
* Ekko Lightbox NPM
* Jarallax NPM
* Formspree.io

## Design
The design of this website was created using MDBootstrap with my own external styling. Many CDNs were used as well to achieve the desired UX including AOS (to create card animations as the webpage is scrolled), Ekko Lightbox (to create lightbox image and video galleries), Jarallax (to create parallax image effects), and font awesome for icons. Thanks to the grid system internal to bootstrap the website is fully mobile responsive with only a few minor additions via media queries. Look below to see the final project.
